# Magilligan Oyster Farm

Welcome to Magilligan Oyster Farm, a family-owned business dedicated to cultivating high-quality oysters in the Lough Foyle area. Our oysters are known for their exceptional taste and texture, and we take pride in our sustainable farming practices.

## About Us

We have over 30 years of experience in the oyster industry, including dredging. Our expertise in sustainable farming practices ensures that our oysters are grown with minimal impact on the seabed and marine life.

## Our Oysters

### Gigga Oysters
Our Gigga oysters are renowned for their high meat content, which is a result of the natural alluvium and mineral-rich glacial deposits in the Lough Foyle area. These oysters also benefit from the natural movements of the tides, which promote quick growth and less physical trauma.

### Pacific Oysters
Our Pacific oysters are dredged from Lough Swilly, where they thrive in the nutrient-rich waters. These oysters are known for their exceptional flavor and texture.

### Native Flat Oysters
We also cultivate native flat oysters, which are primarily found in Lough Foyle. These oysters are a true delicacy and are highly sought after by discerning customers.

## Why Choose Magilligan Oyster Farm?

### Experience
With over 30 years of experience in the oyster industry, including dredging, we have a deep understanding of sustainable farming practices and the benefits of minimizing the impact on the seabed and marine life.

### Sustainability
We use natural feeding methods, relying on the natural flow of alluvium from the iron-rich River Roe to boost the natural iron content and promote healthy growth in our oysters. We do not use any chemicals or additional feed.

### Deployment

 <p><a href="https://maireadwci.github.io/Magilligan-Oyster-Farm-Website/index.html"></a> Github deployed pages</a></p>
 <p><a href="https://github.com/MaireadWCI/Magilligan-Oyster-Farm-Website"></a>Repository</p>


### Looking forward
<p>This site is to be used for an actual company that require updated vidoes and pictures. Most are genuine picture but some are placeholders. Drone footage is scheduled and will be uploaded to site.</p>
<p>The contact section will need the appropriate coding added to link directly to the companies site. </p>
<p>The gallery section as stated above will be updated with new imanges and at that time will make the main and the footer more seamless across all devices.</p>
<p>Map location is not exactly how I would like it to respond. I intend on working on its positioning so It is more aligned to the right of the display in larger screen sizes.</p>
